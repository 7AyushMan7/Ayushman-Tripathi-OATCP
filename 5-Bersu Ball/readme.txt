This code simulates the process of forming pairs of boys and girls for a social gathering, with the constraint that the age difference between a boy and a girl in a pair should be at most one (the Bersu Ball problem).
It takes two inputs: the number of boys (boysCount) and the number of girls (girlsCount).
It reads the ages of boys and girls into arrays boys[] and girls[] respectively.
It sorts the arrays boys[] and girls[] in non-decreasing order of ages.
It then iterates through each boy and girl, trying to form pairs.
If the absolute difference in ages between a boy and a girl is less than 2, they form a pair. The girl is marked as 'visited' to prevent pairing with another boy.
Finally, it outputs the count of pairs formed.
